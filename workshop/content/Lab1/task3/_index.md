Let's make sure your workstation has been configured properly:  
* Do you see a value similar to `i-0123456789abcdef0` (the value may vary) for the **bastionInstance** CloudFormation stack output key?  

If so, you may proceed to the next lab. Otherwise please revisit the instructions above, you might have missed a step.
