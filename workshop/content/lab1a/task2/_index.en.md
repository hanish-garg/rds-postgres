Let's make sure your workstation has been configured properly. Type the following command in the Session Manager command line:

```
tail -n1 /debug.log
```

You should see the output: `* bootstrap complete, rebooting`, if that is not the output you see, please wait a few more minutes and retry.
Once you have verified the environment is configured correctly, you can proceed to the next lab.
